# Nucamp Redux Workshop assignment
## Description 
This website was fixed to use redux allowing adding, removing completed, clearing all, and removing one todo. 
## Tasks
<ol><li>Tasks do not render on the page. There should be 2 when the
                  page loads.
                </li>
                <li>Can't add tasks.</li>
                <li>
                  The tasks do not toggle when clicked. This should be
                  dispatched into redux.
                </li>
                <li>Completed tasks do not remove.</li>
                <li>All tasks do not remove.</li>
                <div>Extra:</div>
                <li>Ability to remove single tasks.</li></ol>
